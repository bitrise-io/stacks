The cURL project has recently published a security advisory for [CVE-2023-38545](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html).

**This vulnerability affects the SOCKS5 proxy feature of cURL.**

The advisory's recommendations are:

> A - Upgrade curl to version 8.4.0
>
> B - Apply the patch to your local version
>
> C - Do not use CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME proxies with curl
>
> D - Do not set a proxy environment variable to socks5h://

## Bitrise stacks

Bitrise stacks ship with the `curl` CLI tool, as well as the `libcurl` package on Linux.

### macOS

The macOS stacks contain two `curl` packages:

- `/usr/bin/curl` as part of macOS: this version (8.1.2) is affected by the vulnerability
- `/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin`, installed via Homebrew: this version (8.1.2 or 8.3.0, depending on the exact stack) is also affected by the vulnerability

**Because of Homebrew's default behavior, the Homebrew `curl` package is not added to `$PATH`, so most `curl` invocations default to the macOS-provided `curl` binary.** When installing cURL, Homebrew explains this behavior:

```
curl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have curl first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Linux

The Bitrise Linux stack is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The stack ships with latest available `curl` and `libcurl` packages available from the official [Ubuntu repositories](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=curl&searchon=names&suite=focal&section=all), version `7.68.0`. **This version is outside the range of vulnerable versions (7.69.0 to and including 8.3.0).**

## Our response

We are taking the following actions:

### Update Homebrew-provided curl on macOS stacks

We are updating the macOS stacks by upgrading the Homebrew-provided cURL package on the stacks. We'll update this post once the stack updates are released, as well as the [changelogs]({{% ref "/changelogs" %}}) pages.

Update: the following stacks are updated with cURL 8.4.0:

- [Xcode 15.0 with edge updates]({{% ref "/changelogs/osx-xcode-15.0.x-edge.md" %}}) (2023-10-12)
- [Xcode 15.1 with edge updates]({{% ref "/changelogs/osx-xcode-15.1.x-edge.md" %}}) (2023-10-12)
- [Xcode 14.0]({{% ref "/changelogs/osx-xcode-14.0.x-ventura.md" %}}) (2023-10-17)
- [Xcode 14.1]({{% ref "/changelogs/osx-xcode-14.1.x-ventura.md" %}}) (2023-10-17)
- [Xcode 14.2]({{% ref "/changelogs/osx-xcode-14.2.x-ventura.md" %}}) (2023-10-17)
- [Xcode 14.3]({{% ref "/changelogs/osx-xcode-14.3.x-ventura.md" %}}) (2023-10-17)
- [Xcode 15.0]({{% ref "/changelogs/osx-xcode-15.0.x.md" %}}) (2023-10-17)

**However, the macOS-provided `curl` binary remains the default in `$PATH`**, and we want to avoid sudden build failures by upgrading such a fundamental tool for every Bitrise user. If your use case involves the SOCKS5 proxy feature of cURL, you can activate the latest cURL version provided by Homebrew by running the following in a script step:

```sh
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"
envman add --key PATH --value $PATH
```

You can also upgrade `curl` right now by running:

```sh
unset HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API
brew update
brew upgrade curl
```
