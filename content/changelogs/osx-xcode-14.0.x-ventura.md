### Stack update `v2023-07-18`

- Tool version aliases: tools managed via ASDF got special alias versions for every `major` and `major.minor` version. These aliases always point to the latest installed patch version and can be selected like the regular versions. Examples:

### Stack update `v2023-07-12`

### Stack update `v2023-07-03`

- Default Ruby version has changed from 2.7.6 to 3.2.2 according to the [deprecation plan](https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/ruby-2-7-x-deprecation/22544).

### Stack update `v2023-06-22`

- Ruby versions are now managed via [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). During the transition period, both `rbenv` and `asdf` are installed and can be used, but we recommend migrating to `asdf`, which also manages Node.js and Go versions on the stacks.
- Default Ruby version has changed from 2.7.6 to 3.2.2 according to the [deprecation plan](https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/ruby-2-7-x-deprecation/22544).
- Each installed iOS simulator runtime now has a device named `Bitrise iOS default`. This name is constant across all runtime versions, but the real device type changes based on the iOS version. You can use this device name in test steps and destination specifiers and be sure that itâ€™s going to be available across all Xcode and runtime versions.
- The `cmake;3.10.2.4988404` Android SDK package is now preinstalled
- [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/) is now preinstalled
