## Updates

### Stack update `v2024-05-07` (released on 2024-05-08)

- Homebrew package installs now use the [new JSON API introduced in Homebrew 4.0](https://brew.sh/2023/02/16/homebrew-4.0.0/). This should not make any difference in practice, but you can still revert to the old behavior by setting the `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1` env var.
- Related: the `brew-install` step has a [new major version](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-brew-install/releases/tag/1.0.0) that speeds up installs and make them more reproducible.

To ensure your workflows remain efficient and utilize the most recent tool updates, we recommend using version aliases in your configurations. Version aliases help you automatically adopt new patch versions without the need for manual updates. For detailed information on how to use version aliases with your Bitrise stacks, please refer to our [Version Aliases Documentation](https://stacks.bitrise.io/tips/tool-versions/#version-aliases)

### Stack update `v2023-09-08`

- Brew cache update & security fixes.

### Stack update `v2023-07-18`

- Tool version aliases: tools managed via ASDF got special alias versions for every `major` and `major.minor` version. These aliases always point to the latest installed patch version and can be selected like the regular versions. Examples:
  - `asdf global ruby 3.2`

### Stack update `v2023-06-22`

- Ruby versions are now managed via [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). During the transition period, both `rbenv` and `asdf` are installed and can be used, but we recommend migrating to `asdf`, which also manages Node.js and Go versions on the stacks.
- Default Ruby version has changed from 2.7.6 to 3.2.2 according to the [deprecation plan](https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/ruby-2-7-x-deprecation/22544).

You can use this device name in test steps and destination specifiers and be sure that itâ€™s going to be available across all Xcode and runtime versions.
- The `cmake;3.10.2.4988404` Android SDK package is now preinstalled
