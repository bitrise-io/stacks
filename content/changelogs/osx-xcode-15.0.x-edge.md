## Updates

### Stack update `v2023-10-27`

- Brew package and cache update

### Stack update `v2023-10-12`

- [Xcode 15.0.1 Release Candidate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-15_0_1-release-notes), is available replacing 15.0 GA
-  The brew provided cURL has been updated to version 8.4.0, more details: [cURL CVE-2023-38545](https://stacks.bitrise.io/announcements/curl-cve-2023-38545/)

### Stack update `v2023-10-04`

**Known issue**: Because [Xcode 15.1 Beta 1]({{% ref "/stack_reports/osx-xcode-15.1.x-edge.md" %}}) is installed side-by-side on the same VM and because its matching iOS simulator runtime is `iOS 17.0.1`, it could cause conflicts with the simulator of Xcode 15.0 (`iOS 17.0`). Workaround: Xcode test destinations should specify `OS=17.0` instead of `OS=latest`.

- `swift-format` updated to version 509
- Go 1.20.7 updated to 1.20.8, 1.21.0 updated to 1.21.1
- Node.js 20.5.1 updated to 20.6.1

- The default Node.js version has changed to 18 (from 20) as [this is the current LTS version](https://endoflife.date/nodejs). Node 20 remains installed as the most up-to-date version, but Node 18 is going to be the default version when Xcode 15 becomes stable.

### Stack update `v2023-08-23`

- Ruby version 3.1.0 has been removed as it's been broken for a while. Version 3.1.0 cannot be reliably installed on macOS because of [this bug](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18912); the first fixed version of the 3.1 series is 3.1.3. This version is available preinstalled.

### Stack update `v2023-07-26`

- [Xcode 15 Beta 5](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-15-release-notes) is available, replacing Beta 4.

### Stack update `v2023-07-18`

- Tool version aliases: tools managed via ASDF got special alias versions for every `major` and `major.minor` version. These aliases always point to the latest installed patch version and can be selected like the regular versions. Examples:
  - `asdf global ruby 3.2`
  - `asdf global nodejs 19`
  - `asdf global golang 1.20`
- Default tool versions are now set to `major.minor` aliases and the exact patch version might change in the future:
  - Ruby: `3.2`
  - Golang: `1.20`
  - Node.js: `20.4`

### Stack update `v2023-07-12`

  - watchOS 9.4

### Stack update `v2023-06-22`

- Ruby versions are now managed via [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). During the transition period, both `rbenv` and `asdf` are installed and can be used, but we recommend migrating to `asdf`, which also manages Node.js and Go versions on the stacks.
- Default Ruby version has changed from 2.7.6 to 3.2.2 according to the [deprecation plan](https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/ruby-2-7-x-deprecation/22544).
- Each installed iOS simulator runtime now has a device named `Bitrise iOS default`. This name is constant across all runtime versions, but the real device type changes based on the iOS version. You can use this device name in test steps and destination specifiers and be sure that itâ€™s going to be available across all Xcode and runtime versions.
